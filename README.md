# US Airlines Sentiment Analysis - ALY 6040

## Project Overview
This project is part of the ALY 6040 Data Mining Applications course at Northeastern University. It involves sentiment analysis of tweets about US airlines, aiming to identify the prevailing sentiments among travelers and uncover the reasons behind negative customer feedback.

## Dataset
The Twitter US Airline Sentiment dataset, scraped from Twitter in February 2015, includes tweets about six major US airlines, classified into positive, neutral, and negative sentiments.

## Tools and Techniques
- **Data Preprocessing**: Utilized R for data cleaning, handling missing values, and preprocessing text data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted using ggplot2 and other visualization libraries in R to uncover trends and insights from the tweet data.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Applied Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multinomial Logistic Regression models to predict tweet sentiments.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessed model performance using accuracy, F1 scores, and confusion matrices.

## Key Findings
- The majority of tweets in the dataset expressed negative sentiments towards the airlines.
- Customer service issues and late flights were the most common reasons for negative sentiments.
- The SVM model achieved the highest accuracy, making it the top-performing model for this sentiment analysis task.
